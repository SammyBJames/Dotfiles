# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of dotfiles. This repository contains the configurations for my Arch Linux setup running Hyprland. As I'm just getting started with all the fancy stuff, these are a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to rice my setup.

## Software

I use the following primary applications and tools:

| Category              | Application         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Distro**            | Arch                |
| **WM / Compositor**   | Hyprland            |
| **Status Bar**        | Waybar              |
| **App Launcher**      | Wofi                |
| **Terminal**          | Alacritty           |
| **Shell**             | Zsh                 |
